# Welcome to the Pomodoro Project!

 Hi, I'm Maya! And welcome to the Pomodoro Project, a simple machine I made for my NVIDIA class! It tells you when to take study breaks based on the time you put in. It also shows you while your working, so you can see if you are distracted or not. Use my machine with caution, but with intrigue. I am not a natural NVIDIA coder, but I hope this will work for some of you.

## The Algorithm

This project relies on the user building a webcam inside the notebook. They rely on matplotlib to help display the values they are putting in, as well as variety of other imports. This project also lets the user make a simple countdown timer through Python simply using a variable counting down, using a float to convert seconds to minutes. With the help of connecting the Jetson Nano's webcam, the user is able to see themselves while they study, as well as following the countdown.

## Running this project

1. For running this project, you need to make a new Google Colab notebook. Open it up.
2. Connect your NVIDIA with its webcam.
3. Simply follow the instructions to set up the countdown and the webcam.
4. Congrats! The webcam should be running in your notebook.
5. Do your Pomodoro training! Go wild!


No libraries need to be installed for this project.
