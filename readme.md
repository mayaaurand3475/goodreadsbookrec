# Welcome to the Pomodoro Project!

 Hi, I'm Maya! And welcome to the Pomodoro Project, a simple machine I made for my NVIDIA class! It tells you when to take study breaks based on the time you put in. It also shows you while your working, so you can see if you are distracted or not. Use my machine with caution, but with intrigue.
